# API Key Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements implemented for handling the Google API key in the Meet Halfway App.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables
- Replaced all hardcoded API key references with environment variable access using `flutter_dotenv`
- Created `.env.example` template file to guide users on setting up their own API keys
- Ensured `.env` is properly listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

### 2. Modified Files
- `location_service.dart`: Updated all API endpoints to use `dotenv.env['GOOGLE_API_KEY']`
- `place_service.dart`: Updated all API endpoints to use `dotenv.env['GOOGLE_API_KEY']`

### 3. Implementation Details
The app now loads environment variables at startup in `main.dart`:
```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  // Ensure all bindings are initialized and load .env
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env"); // Load .env before runApp

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

All service files now access the API key securely:
```dart
// Example from location_service.dart
final url = Uri.parse(
  'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=$address&key=${dotenv.env['GOOGLE_API_KEY']}'
);
```

## Setup Instructions for Developers

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory
2. Add your Google API key to the file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
4. For team members, share the API key through secure channels

## Alternative Approach for Native Platforms

If you prefer to use platform-specific methods for storing API keys:

### Android
You can store the API key in `android/app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="google_maps_api_key">your_api_key_here</string>
</resources>
```

Then access it in your Flutter code using platform channels.

### iOS
You can store the API key in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>GoogleMapsAPIKey</key>
<string>your_api_key_here</string>
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Restrict API key usage in Google Cloud Console
   - Set application restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses, etc.)
   - Enable only the specific APIs needed by your application
   
2. Monitor API usage regularly
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Review usage patterns to detect potential abuse

3. Rotate API keys periodically
   - Create a new key before disabling the old one
   - Update all instances where the key is used

4. Consider using a backend proxy for sensitive API calls
   - This prevents exposing the API key in client-side code
   - Implement rate limiting and additional security measures

## Conclusion
These changes significantly improve the security of the API key handling in the Meet Halfway App. The key is now loaded from environment variables and is properly protected from being accidentally committed to version control.
